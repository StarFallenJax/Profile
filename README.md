## 💡 About the project

This is an open source project of mine, designed to streamline all of my public social media profiles and projects into one neat place. Originally, this started off as just a free alternative to linktree, however, my ambitions grew. Below here is the original linktree example I based mine off of.
- [Demo](https://spacemanjax.github.io/Linktree/)

## 🧰 Create your own linktree

- If you like this work and want to have a head start in making your own version, fork this repository and change the information in ```index.html```, then set up [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the website.
